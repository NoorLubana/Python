#there aare two types of files
#1.text files-you can open and edit it   ..use rt -to read in text
#2.binary file-very difficult to read and open....use rb-to resd in binary

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#to open a file in python we have two parameters
#1.open()    to open any file just put the name open("name of file")
#2.mode - it will ask us to read or write


# f=open("sample.txt","r")  #r--to read and w- to write
# data=f.read()                           #u cannot use 2 times to f.read
# print(data)
# f.close   #at the end always close the file


#5. if you want to read any 5 characters just put the numbers in the f.read(5)
# f=open("sample.txt","r")  #r--to read and w- to write
# data=f.read(5)
# print(data)
# f.close



#readline-to read 2 times or print line one after the another...in readline u can use it many times in a program
# f=open("sample.txt","r")  #r--to read and w- to write
# data=f.readline()
# print(data)
# data=f.readline()
# print(data)
# f.close


# modes of opening a file
# read,write,append,updating
